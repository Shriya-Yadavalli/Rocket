# Rocket
A little monkey likes to do, 
Just the same as you and you.
When you sit up very tall,
Monkey sits up very tall.
When you pretend to throw a ball,
Monkey pretends to throw a ball.
When you try to touch your toes,
Monkey tries to touch his toes.
When you move you litle nose,
Monkey moves his little nose.
When you jump in the air,
Monkey jumps in the air.
When you sit down in a chair,
Monkey sits down in a chair.
